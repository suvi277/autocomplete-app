# Code Overview

This is a React TypeScript app with an Autocomplete component. It fetches data from the dummy API provided by [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) using the [Todos API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) with a search query parameter (?q=${searchTerm}) to retrieve suggestion results. 
Example - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?q=quam

## Runs the app in the development mode

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

##  To run the test
### `npm test`

## Improvements

Here are some improvements I could consider for the Autocomplete component if time wasn't a constraint and if I would look for production ready code

1. Performance Optimization:
2. Accessibility Enhancements
3. Customization Options
4. Error Handling
5. Code Optimization and Refactoring
6. Add end to end test coverage
7. Better Styles
